<!-- 14. What is the difference between "class" and "id" in CSS? Give an example of when you would use each one. -->
<!-- class 
class with same name  can be used in multiple tag in html it is declared as <elementname class="" in css it is declared using ( . )operator. 
 id 
 we can not use same id name with multiple tag i.e it should be unique in html declared as <elementname id="" in css it is declared as # operator 
 The most basic precedence you should understand, however, is that id selectors take precedence over class selectors -->
